# OpenTracing documentation

This repository will eventually house the source material for the documentation for the [OpenTracing](http://opentracing.io/documentation/) project.

For the time being, that source material can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/opentracing/opentracing.io/tree/master/_docs).
